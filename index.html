                            The artwork features three projection walls and a shadow wall, immersing the audience in a hellish experience that symbolizes spiritual refinement through fire. Inspired by Buddhist reincarnation and the phoenix myth, it incorporates sounds like Buddhist chants and Christian choirs.

                            This artwork aims to pay tribute to the moiré pattern and explores its artistic possibilities in the new era. We plan to combine fashion design, performance art, and visual design by having models (actors) wear clothing with a moiré skirt or cloak, walking on a stage that can display moiré patterns. As the person moves, the moiré patterns behind them will animate and follow their movements.

The inherent essence of this calligraphic style shares a common spirit with the orderly nature of metal and machinery.

                          This game is an experimental project I created while studying game development. Originally, the task was to recreate a classic brick-breaking game, but I attempted to incorporate it with my original field of study, resulting in a more stylized background. In this game, the gravity in the upper half of the game interface is completely reversed. Players need to control the paddles on both sides to strike the ball and eliminate all the bricks to escape the mirrored space. The outcome of the game, whether success or failure, will lead to certain differences in the settlement interface.

Although I have completed the code and map design for the basic movements of the characters, the project was terminated due to time constraints.
